## Welcome to my Page!

I am a coder based in Bengaluru.
I started my coding career as a C developer for Telecommunication projects.
I later reskilled in Android and have my app on Playstore.
At present I am learning Javascript.

### My Playstore link

https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=MeeM

When I had to take the decision of reskilling I chose application layer so that I can also get to be artistic and creative... and I love colors!
I am looking for freelance assignments in C, Javascript, HTML and CSS

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Meenohara/meenohara.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
