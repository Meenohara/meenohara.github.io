##Service
I have been fortunate to have generous mentors for coaching with coding, job hunt(who made me take steps to improve this page), my life mentor who is always holding my hand and many people who have helped me in my life journey as well as coding journey.
I want to pay this forward by having my own community https://ucanbounceback.slack.com/ which I started as an initiative for people who want to bounce back from setbacks especially if it has affected them professionally. The mission is to inform about work opportunities and helpful resources with getting back to work.
